## ToDo List

- Add Win10 with the RDP allow directly, for having the SSH without RDP and Powershell first
- Change the K8s raw commands, for the k8s module instead
- Test the new r80.40 or the latest version of the CheckPoint (SMS/GW) in Azure
- Add the MicroShift instead of k8s and manage with the k8s modules
- Deploy the application (PacMan instead? or one of the IOL) in MicroShift
- Change the manual commands in the Checkpoint to the new modules (add simple gw api, raw ckp commands, etc)
- Modify the Azure and add force tunneling and proper Routing with Monitorization (NetObsv?, Azure Security Center?)
