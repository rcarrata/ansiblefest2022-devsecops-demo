= Lab TSHOOT - Troubleshooting and solve common problems

== 1 - Overview

Sometime the things failed. The world is not perfect right? Could be due to connection, latency, slow request, github down (oh no!), or any resource that could not be requested at time. 

So if you are experience this, first of all SORRY! We design this lab to be as much as perfect that we could, but there is tons of moving pieces in this lab so it's quite inevitable to something happend.

But here is a guide to try to solve the situation.

=== 1 - Try to repeat the Job Template that failed

Ansible Tower allows you to try to repeat the job template that failed with the same parameters and vars:

++++
<p align="center">

</p>
++++

Click in the Rocket icon beside the Failed Status, and click to All to relaunch all of the tasks (not press Failed).

=== 2 - Fail when the SMS or GW is deployed 

* Error deploying R80.40 or R81.10:

```
Deployment failed with status code: 400 and message: Marketplace purchase eligibilty check returned errors. See inner errors for details. 
```

* Root Cause:

The terms in Azure for these new images are not accepted.

* Resolution:

Accept Azure Marketplace term so that the image can be used to create VMs. Check in the Resource Group and see the error.

For solve, the https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/vm/image?view=azure-cli-latest#az-vm-image-accept-terms[Checkpoint image terms] need to be accepted.

```bash
az vm image accept-terms --urn checkpoint:check-point-cg-r8110:sg-byol:latest
```
