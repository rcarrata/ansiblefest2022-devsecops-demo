== Lab Overview

In this hands-on lab, we will cover the comprehensive Cybersecurity capabilities available in Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform and Checkpoint Threat Prevention Systems. You will gain experience with:

* Hands on with Ansible Automation Platform and how to integrate them through cloud native environments as Microsoft Azure.

* Define as a code all the objects of Ansible Automation Platform (Job Templates, Inventories, Workflows, Nodes, etc).

* Automatic deployment of a fully functional Checkpoint environment with Security Management Server and Gateway.

* Automatic installation and configuration of a Windows Server (including installation of Packages and Updates).

* Deployment fully automated of Kubernetes cluster and deployment of an Application of example (Etherpad).

* Deployment fully automated of a Jboss server and deployment of an Application of example (Ticket Monster).

* Deployment and configuration of Checkpoint Rules & Policies for hardening and securing your apps.

* Establish NAT rules and expose your applications through a Checkpoint Gateway, logging and monitoring all the actions through your Apps.

* How to work with **Infrastructure as Code**.

> **EVERYTHING in this lab is deployed as Infra as Code**. **Everything**. No manual actions will be performed in this lab :)

== Lab Environment

The entire lab environment is hosted online and includes Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform^(R)^, Red Hat Enterprise Linux^(R)^, Checkpoint^(R)^ Security Management Virtual Appliances, Checkpoint^(R)^ Security Gateway, Microsoft^(R)^ Windows, Microsoft Azure^(R)^, Red Hat^(R)^ JBoss Web Server and Kubernetes^(R)^.

The lab could be pre-hosted, or you can deploy your own flavor for your own tests (check link::documentation/prelab.doc[prelab.doc] in the documentation).
